Congratulations on making it this far!
We're excited to have you on this journey into TensorFlow -- this is just the beginning! In the coming weeks, here are the additional lessons that will be added into this classroom:

Turn a binary classifier into a multi-class classifier
You'll expand your image classifiers into models that can predict from multiple classes. And, you'll use a convolutional network to build a classifier for more detailed color images.

Transfer Learning
You'll learn to use a pre-trained network to build powerful state-of-the-art classifiers.

Saving and Loading Models
Look at the new SAVEDMODEL format in TensorFlow 2.0 and take advantage of it for TensorFlow-Lite and TensorFlow-Serving

Machine Learning on devices with TensorFlow Lite
Learn how you can use TensorFlow Lite to build machine learning apps on Android, iOS and iOT devices.

Machine Learning in the Cloud with TensorFlow-Serving
Use TensorFlow-Serving to deploy a machine learning model to the cloud.

Machine Learning in-the-browser with TensorFlow.js
Use TensorFlow.js to train models and make predictions all in a browser

Machine Learning-based products and services from Google
Learn about MLKit, ML services on Google Cloud Platform, and put your models on these infrastructures.

The Workflow of Machine Learning
You'll learn about the workflow of Machine Learning and the steps that lead to success. And, learn how to get data, define the problem, understand success, and build and evaluate models.

Managing Data
Learn about data structures in TensorFlow, including tensors and how to manipulate them. And, you'll learn how to get data into TensorFlow from common sources, from CSV to BigQuery.

Exploring Neural Nets in Keras
Dive deep into the inner workings of TensorFlow to learn about tensor operations, gradient-based optimization, and graphs. And, use the Keras layers API to build complex neural networks.

Going deeper into Neural Nets
You'll learn from sequential data with recurrent neural networks, and unsupervised learning with generative adversarial networks.

We hope you're just as excited as we for this journey! You'll find the next batch of lessons in your classroom by April 16th 12 PM PST. Till then, good luck!
